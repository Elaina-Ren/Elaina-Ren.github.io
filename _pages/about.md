# üìù RESEARCH EXPERIENCE 

# Genome Three-Dimensional Spatial Structure Domain Consistency Assessment Platform
**Location:** Tianjin, China  
**Graduation Project:** Scored 90  
**Duration:** Nov. 2023‚ÄìJun. 2024

## Project Highlights

- **Designed a Topological Associated Domain (TAD) Fusion Algorithm based on Multi-layer Graph Neural Networks:**
  - Utilized graph structures to capture complex correlations between TADs.
  - Adopted Graph Neural Network (GNN) models with two layers of `GCNConv` and a global average pooling layer to learn node feature representations on the graph.
  - Proposed a TAD community discovery method based on modularity maximization.
  - Refined community identification by optimizing the objective function to better recognize communities with high internal connectivity.
  - The algorithm, informed by the node classification results of the GNN model, achieves more accurate and reliable TAD boundaries, indicating a closer relationship between consistent TADs and physical TAD structures.

- **Developed a 3D Genomic Spatial Domain Consistency Evaluation Platform:**
  - Built using Web development technologies and the Django framework.
  - Integrated the aforementioned multi-layer GNN-based TAD fusion algorithm and genomic 3D structure identification tools.
  - Provided a computational platform for evaluating the consistency of 3D genomic spatial domains.
  - The web-based platform offers a user-friendly interface and simple operational workflow.
  - Provides data calculation services such as consistency evaluation of different TAD structures and consistency TAD computational analysis.

  - Decreased runtime by 90% compared to User-Based Collaborative Filtering.

# Development of Elderly Cane Obstacle Avoidance System Based on Intelligent Detection Technology
**Location:** Tianjin, China  
**Awards:** Municipal Second Prize, Scholarship for Outstanding Undergraduate Students in AI  
**Role:** Team Leader  
**Duration:** Apr. 2022‚ÄìMar. 2024

## Project Highlights

- **Intelligent Mobility System Development:**
  - Led a team to develop an intelligent mobility system for the elderly using multi-sensor technology.
  - Included fall and obstacle detection, waterlogging identification with YOLOv5, and semantic segmentation.
  - Addressed a critical challenge with the YOLOv5 model: Identified an issue where the model performed worse on smaller sized images on the edge device.
  - Solution: Fine-tuned the model with smaller size training examples minimizing the train-test domain gap, improving performance on the device.

- **Waterlogged Pavement Detection:**
  - Normalized and refined a dataset containing statistics on waterlogged pavement using the YOLOv5 model.
  - Conducted model training and experimental testing using a Raspberry Pi.
  - The final waterlogged pavement detection feedback time was approximately 0.5 seconds, with a 90% accuracy rate.

- **Semantic Segmentation:**
  - Implemented semantic segmentation of blind alleys and crosswalks based on the Inception V3 model.
  - Implemented classification and segmentation of images via classifiers to aid the planning of optimal paths.
